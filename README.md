Hello penguins and humans!
My name is Alex, I am from Mexico. I intend to learn about JS and python. 
I live on Coffe and cold food, I currently work as an L2 tech support and I am used to deal with unix and SQL, particularly DB2 and a little bit of sybase. I am also savvy enough to hold myself into the capital markets, equity is what I have more experience with as I have worked on settlement operations and prematching.

Love tacos and penguins. Interested in blockchain technologies.
